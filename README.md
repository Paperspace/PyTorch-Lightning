# PyTorch-Lightning

Last updated: Oct 21st 2022

Collection of Jupyter notebook tutorials from the [PyTorch Lightning documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/).

Procedure to produce this:

- Navigate to https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/
- Open tutorial under "Hands on Examples"
- Click "Open in Colab"
- File -> Download -> Download .ipynb from Colab's menu
- Upload .ipynb to this repo

This allows the Lightning tutorial content to be easily run on Gradient using our omni container. E.g., use the PyTorch runtime but point to this repo.

*Note*

Most of the notebooks work, but some may have issues, especially the minority that downgrade PyTorch from the runtime version.
